# LTO is fundamentally unsafe for these:
# llvm-core/llvm               nolto.conf
# llvm-core/clang              nolto.conf
# llvm-core/lld                nolto.conf

# well the above failed (llvm) becasue i was using the flag new use instead of jsut -e by itself. YOu cant mix them.

# Conditional cases (safe to disable for now):
